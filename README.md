# EOS Busking ColorPicker
An interactive ETC EOS busking color picker.

# Warning :
At the moment, you need to create your own "go" macro button on your magic sheet
The go smooth time does not work yet. I'm trying to fix it

# Requirements
- You need to run this script on a computer before using in on your EOS desk
- You need python

# How to use
- On your desk, create your groups and color palettes
- On your PC, run the python script : `python color_picker.py`
- Answer the questions asked by the script
- Copy the macros.asc file to an USB stick
- On EOS : Click `File -> Setup -> Import -> USITT ASCII -> As Custom Fixture -> <USB Stick/macros.asc>`
- Click Merge Data and select ONLY macros and MagicSheet
- You're done ! Have fun
